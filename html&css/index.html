    <h2>National Animal</h2>
    <p id="akash"> The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat of fur with
        dark stripes.
        The combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power has earned the tiger its pride of place as the
        national animal of India.</p>
    <h2>National Bird</h2>
    <p class="ash">The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus, the National Bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with
        a fan-shaped crest of feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. The male of the species is
        more colourful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail of
        around 200 elongated feathers. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male and lacks the tail. The
        elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight.</p>
    <h2>National Emblem</h2>
    <P>The state emblem is an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka. In the original, there are four lions,
        standing back to back, mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a
        galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a
        single block of polished sandstone, the Capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).</P>

                <h2> All About ZOO-ZOO</h2><br>
                <p class="mt-4">ZOO-ZOO is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India,
                    and
                    incorporated in
                    Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before
                    expanding
                    into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and
                    lifestyle
                    products.

                    The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal. As of
                    March
                    2017, ZOO-ZOO held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. Flipkart has a dominant
                    position in
                    the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and
                    neck" with
                    Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments
                    service
                    based on the UPI.</p>
